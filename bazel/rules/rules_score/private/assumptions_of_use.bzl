Assumptions of Use build rules for S-CORE projects.

    Assumptions of Use (AoU) define the safety-relevant operating conditions
    and constraints for a Safety Element out of Context (SEooC). They specify
    the conditions under which the component is expected to operate safely
    and the responsibilities of the integrator.

    Args:
        name: The name of the assumptions of use target. Used as the base
            name for all generated targets.
        srcs: List of labels to trlc_requirements targets containing the
            Assumptions of Use specifications as defined in the S-CORE
            process. RST files containing ``aou_req`` directives are also
            accepted and will be converted to TRLC automatically.
        requirements: Optional list of labels to feature or component requirements
            targets that these Assumptions of Use trace to. Establishes
            traceability as defined in the S-CORE process.
        ref_package: Optional TRLC package prefix used for ``derived_from``
            cross-references when converting RST sources.
        visibility: Bazel visibility specification for the generated targets.

    Generated Targets:
        <name>: Main assumptions of use target providing AssumptionsOfUseInfo
        <name>_test: TRLC validation test for the assumptions of use sources

    Example using trlc_requirements targets:

        assumptions_of_use(

            srcs = [":my_aous_trlc"],

            srcs = ["docs/assumptions_of_use.rst"],
