# Rules Score

Starlark rules implementing the **S-CORE** functional-safety development process
for safety related automotive software.

## Rules Overview

![Rules integration overview](docs/rules_score_overview.svg)

| Rule | Providers emitted |
|------|-------------------|
| `feature_requirements` | `FeatureRequirementsInfo` |
| `component_requirements` | `ComponentRequirementsInfo` |
| `assumptions_of_use` | `AssumptionsOfUseInfo` |
| `architectural_design` | `ArchitecturalDesignInfo` |
| `unit` | `UnitInfo`, `CertifiedScope` |
| `component` | `ComponentInfo` |
| `fmea` | `AnalysisInfo` |
| `dependability_analysis` | `DependabilityAnalysisInfo` |
| `dependable_element` | HTML documentation zip (Sphinx) |

All rules also emit `SphinxSourcesInfo` for the documentation assembly pipeline.

## `feature_requirements` / `component_requirements`

```starlark
load("@trlc//:trlc.bzl", "trlc_requirements")
load("//bazel/rules/rules_score:rules_score.bzl", "feature_requirements")

trlc_requirements(
    name = "my_trlc_reqs",
    srcs = ["requirements.trlc"],
    spec = ["@score_tooling//bazel/rules/rules_score/trlc/config:score_requirements_model"],
)

feature_requirements(
    name = "my_feat_reqs",
    srcs = [":my_trlc_reqs"],
)
```

**`bazel build`** — collects `TrlcProviderInfo` from the underlying
`trlc_requirements` targets and produces `.lobster` files for LOBSTER.
Also generates a `_test` target that validates metamodel compliance.

---

## `assumptions_of_use`

```starlark
assumptions_of_use(
    name = "my_aou",
    requirements = [":my_feat_reqs"],
    srcs = ["assumptions.rst"],
)
```

**`bazel build`** — collects LOBSTER traceability files from the linked
requirements and exposes them via `AssumptionsOfUseInfo`.

---

## `architectural_design`

```starlark
architectural_design(
    name = "my_design",
    static = ["class.puml", "component.puml"],
    dynamic = ["sequence.puml"],
    public_api = ["api.puml"],
)
```

**`bazel build`** — runs `puml_parser` on every `.puml` file, producing:
- a `.fbs.bin` FlatBuffers binary (diagram AST) — consumed by validation/core checks
- a `.lobster` traceability file (Interface elements only) — consumed by LOBSTER
- a `plantuml_links.json` — consumed by the `clickable_plantuml` Sphinx extension

Diagrams in `public_api` are classified separately so their lobster items flow
through `public_api_lobster_files` for failure-mode traceability.

---

## `unit`

```starlark
unit(
    name = "my_unit",
    unit_design = [":my_design"],
    implementation = [":my_lib"],
    tests = [":my_tests"],
)
```

**`bazel build`** — wraps implementation targets and collects design + test
references into `UnitInfo`. Also runs unit tests via `gtest_report` and
produces `.lobster` traceability items for LOBSTER.

**`bazel test`** — executes the wrapped test targets.

---

## `component`

```starlark
component(
    name = "my_component",
    requirements = [":my_comp_reqs"],
    components = [":unit_a", ":unit_b"],
    tests = [],
)
```

**`bazel build`** — aggregates `UnitInfo` / nested `ComponentInfo` providers
and collects requirement + architecture + test lobster sources.

**`bazel test`** — runs component-level integration tests passed via `tests`.

---

## `fmea`

```starlark
fmea(
    name = "my_fmea",
    failuremodes = [":failure_modes"],
    controlmeasures = [":control_measures"],
    root_causes = ["fta.puml"],
    arch_design = ":my_design",
)
```

**`bazel build`** — generates `fmea.rst` (merged FM / CM / FTA sections),
runs `lobster-trlc` on TRLC inputs, and extracts FTA events from `.puml`
diagrams into `fta.lobster`. Build-only; traceability validation is done
by the wrapping `dependability_analysis` test.

---

## `dependability_analysis`

```starlark
dependability_analysis(
    name = "my_da",
    fmea = [":my_fmea"],
    arch_design = ":my_design",
)
```

**`bazel build`** — collects `.lobster` files from all sub-analyses and
architectural design, expands the `lobster_sa.conf` template, and runs
`lobster-ci-report` to produce a traceability report JSON + HTML.

**`bazel test`** — asserts that `lobster-ci-report` exits with code 0
(all traceability links are satisfied). This is the primary
**safety-analysis traceability gate**.

```bash
bazel test //examples/seooc:sample_dependability_analysis
```

---

## `dependable_element`

```starlark
dependable_element(
    name = "my_seooc",
    description = "My safety element",
    integrity_level = "B",
    requirements = [":feat_reqs"],
    architectural_design = [":my_design"],
    dependability_analysis = [":my_da"],
    components = [":my_component"],
    assumptions_of_use = [],
    tests = [],
)
```

**`bazel build`** — generates a complete HTML documentation zip via Sphinx.
Internally:
1. `_dependable_element_index` generates an `index.rst` aggregating all
    artifacts, runs validation/core architecture checks as a subrule, and
   produces a DE-level LOBSTER report (`lobster_de.conf` template covering
   Feature Req → Component Req → Architecture → Public API → Failure Modes).
2. `sphinx_module` compiles all RST sources + diagrams into an HTML zip.

**`bazel test`** — runs the LOBSTER CI report embedded in the index rule
and all component / unit tests transitively.

```bash
bazel build //examples/seooc:safety_software_seooc_example   # HTML zip
bazel test  //examples/seooc:safety_software_seooc_example   # all tests
```
